[![Travis-CI Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/robinsones/funneljoin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robinsones/funneljoin)
[![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/funneljoin)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=funneljoin)

The goal of funneljoin is to make it easy to analyze behavior funnels.
For example, maybe you’re interested in finding the people who visit a
page and then register. Or you want all the times people click on an
item and add it to their cart within 2 days. These can all be answered
quickly with funneljoin’s `after_join()` or `funnel_start()` and
`funnel_step()`. As funneljoin uses dplyr, it can also work with remote
tables, **but has only been tried on postgres**.

For more examples of how to use funneljoin, check out [the
vignette](https://robinsones.github.io/funneljoin/articles/funneljoin.html),
which shows different types of joins and the optional arguments, or this
[blog
post](https://hookedondata.org/introducing-the-funneljoin-package/),
which showcases how to use funneljoin analyze questions and answers on
StackOverflow.

Funneljoin was developed at [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) by
Anthony Baker, David Robinson, and Emily Robinson and continues to be
maintained primarily by Emily.

## Installation

You can install this package from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("funneljoin")
```

Or you can install the development version from GitHub with
[remotes](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes):

``` r
library(remotes)
install_github("robinsones/funneljoin")
```

## after\_join()

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(funneljoin)
```

We’ll take a look at two tables that come with the package, `landed` and
`registered`. Each has a column `user_id` and `timestamp`.

Let’s say we wanted to get the first time people landed and the first
time afterward they registered. We would `after_inner_join()` with a
`first-firstafter` type:

``` r
landed %>%
  after_inner_join(registered, 
                   by_user = "user_id",
                   by_time = "timestamp",
                   type = "first-firstafter",
                   suffix = c("_landed", "_registered"))
#> # A tibble: 5 x 3
#>   user_id timestamp_landed timestamp_registered
#>     <dbl> <date>           <date>              
#> 1       1 2018-07-01       2018-07-02          
#> 2       4 2018-07-01       2018-07-02          
#> 3       3 2018-07-02       2018-07-02          
#> 4       6 2018-07-07       2018-07-10          
#> 5       5 2018-07-10       2018-07-11
```

The first two arguments are the tables we’re joining, with the first
table being the events that happen first. We then specify:

  - `by_time`: the time columns in each table. This would typically be a
    datetime or a date column. These columns are used to filter for time
    y being after or the same as time x.
  - `by_user`:the user or identity columns in each table. These must be
    identical for a pair of rows to match.
  - `type`: the type of funnel used to distinguish between event pairs,
    such as “first-first”, “last-first”, “any-firstafter”.
  - `suffix` (optional): just like dplyr’s join functions, this
    specifies what should be appended to the names of columns that are
    in both tables.

`type` can be any combination of `first`, `last`, `any`, and
`lastbefore` with `first`, `last`, `any`, and `firstafter`. Some common
ones you may use include:

  - **first-first**: Take the earliest x and y for each user **before**
    joining. For example, you want the first time someone entered an
    experiment, followed by the first time someone **ever** registered.
    If they registered, entered the experiment, and registered again,
    you do not want to include that person.
  - **first-firstafter**: Take the first x, then the first y after that.
    For example, you want when someone first entered an experiment and
    the first course they started afterwards. You don’t care if they
    started courses before entering the experiment.
  - **lastbefore-firstafter**: First x that’s followed by a y before the
    next x. For example, in last click paid ad attribution, you want the
    last ad someone clicked before the first subscription they did
    afterward.
  - **any-firstafter**: Take all Xs followed by the first Y after it.
    For example, you want all the times someone visited a homepage and
    their first product page they visited afterwards.
  - **any-any**: Take all Xs followed by all Ys. For example, you want
    all the times someone visited a homepage and **all** the product
    pages they saw afterward.

If your time and user columns have different names, you can work with
that too:

``` r
landed <- landed %>%
  rename(landed_at = timestamp,
         user_id_x = user_id)

registered <- registered %>%
  rename(registered_at = timestamp,
         user_id_y = user_id)
```

``` r
landed %>%
  after_inner_join(registered, 
                   by_user = c("user_id_x" = "user_id_y"),
                   by_time = c("landed_at" = "registered_at"),
                   type = "first-first")
#> # A tibble: 4 x 3
#>   user_id_x landed_at  registered_at
#>       <dbl> <date>     <date>       
#> 1         1 2018-07-01 2018-07-02   
#> 2         3 2018-07-02 2018-07-02   
#> 3         6 2018-07-07 2018-07-10   
#> 4         5 2018-07-10 2018-07-11
```

## funnel\_start() and funnel\_step()

Sometimes you have all the data you need in one table. For example,
let’s look at this table of user activity on a website.

``` r
activity <- tibble::tribble(
  ~ "user_id", ~ "event", ~ "timestamp",
  1, "landing", "2019-07-01",
  1, "registration", "2019-07-02",
  1, "purchase", "2019-07-07",
  1, "purchase", "2019-07-10",
  2, "landing", "2019-08-01",
  2, "registration", "2019-08-15",
  3, "landing", "2019-05-01",
  3, "registration", "2019-06-01",
  3, "purchase", "2019-06-04",
  4, "landing", "2019-06-13"
)
```

We can use `funnel_start()` and `funnel_step()` to make an activity
funnel. `funnel_start()` takes five arguments:

  - `tbl`: The table of events.
  - `moment_type`: The first moment, or event, in the funnel.
  - `moment`: The name of the column that indicates the `moment_type`.
  - `tstamp`: The name of the column with the timestamps of the moment.
  - `user`: The name of the column indicating the user who did the
    moment.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
activity %>%
  funnel_start(moment_type = "landing", 
               moment = "event", 
               tstamp = "timestamp", 
               user = "user_id")
#> # A tibble: 4 x 2
#>   user_id timestamp_landing
#>     <dbl> <chr>            
#> 1       1 2019-07-01       
#> 2       2 2019-08-01       
#> 3       3 2019-05-01       
#> 4       4 2019-06-13
```

`funnel_start()` returns a table with the user\_ids and a column with
the name of your timestamp column, `_`, and the moment type. This table
also includes metadata.

To add more moments to the funnel, you use `funnel_step()`. Since you’ve
indicated in `funnel_start()` what columns to use for each part, now you
only need to have the `moment_type` and the `type` of `after_join()`
(e.g. “first-first”, “first-any”).

``` r
activity %>%
  funnel_start(moment_type = "landing", 
               moment = "event", 
               tstamp = "timestamp", 
               user = "user_id") %>%
  funnel_step(moment_type = "registration",
              type = "first-firstafter")
#> # A tibble: 4 x 3
#>   user_id timestamp_landing timestamp_registration
#>     <dbl> <chr>             <chr>                 
#> 1       3 2019-05-01        2019-06-01            
#> 2       4 2019-06-13        <NA>                  
#> 3       1 2019-07-01        2019-07-02            
#> 4       2 2019-08-01        2019-08-15
```

You can continue stacking on `funnel_step()` with more moments.

``` r
activity %>%
  funnel_start(moment_type = "landing", 
               moment = "event", 
               tstamp = "timestamp", 
               user = "user_id") %>%
  funnel_step(moment_type = "registration",
              type = "first-firstafter") %>%
  funnel_step(moment_type = "purchase",
              type = "first-any")
#> # A tibble: 5 x 4
#>   user_id timestamp_landing timestamp_registration timestamp_purchase
#>     <dbl> <chr>             <chr>                  <chr>             
#> 1       3 2019-05-01        2019-06-01             2019-06-04        
#> 2       1 2019-07-01        2019-07-02             2019-07-07        
#> 3       1 2019-07-01        2019-07-02             2019-07-10        
#> 4       2 2019-08-01        2019-08-15             <NA>              
#> 5       4 2019-06-13        <NA>                   <NA>
```

If you use a `type` that allows multiple moments of one type for a user,
like “first-any”, you will get more rows per user rather than more
columns. For example, user 1 had two purchases, so she now has two rows.
The `timestamp_landing` and `timestamp_registration` is the same for
both rows, but they have a different `timestamp_purchase`.

Finally, you can use the `summarize_funnel()` to understand how many and
what percentage of people make it through to each next step of the
funnel. We can also switch to `funnel_steps()` to shorten our code a
bit: we give it a character vector of `moment_types` in order and the
`type` for each step.

``` r
activity %>%
  funnel_start(moment_type = "landing", 
               moment = "event", 
               tstamp = "timestamp", 
               user = "user_id") %>%
  funnel_steps(moment_types = c("registration", "purchase"),
              type = "first-firstafter") %>%
  summarize_funnel()
#> # A tibble: 3 x 4
#>   moment_type  nb_step pct_cumulative pct_step
#>   <fct>          <int>          <dbl>    <dbl>
#> 1 landing            4           1      NA    
#> 2 registration       3           0.75    0.75 
#> 3 purchase           2           0.5     0.667
```

`nb_step` is how many users made it to each step, `pct_cumulative` is
what percent that is out of the original step, and `pct_step` is what
percentage that is out of those who made it to the previous step. So in
our case, 2 people had a purchase, which is 50% of the people who landed
but 66% of those who registered.
